HW Repo for Mr. K's AP CS Period 7 class

HW/Name - description

01Recursion - practice/code recursive functions
  -fact = factorial (n!)
  -fib = fibonacci numbers
  -sqrt = square root
  -sqrt = 'sqrt' helper function

Mazesolver - example done in class as a foundation / foothold (?) on which to code other recursive functions like KnightsTour or NQueens

02KnightsTour - code KnightsTour (look it up) recursively

03NQueens - code NQueens (look it up) recursively (although there are other methods as well)
