I worked too hard (sorta) on this commit message (that ultimately did not go through because of some weird arrow pressing that lead to a gazillion "git add -Agit add -Agit add -A" clogging up between the 'it works!' and the second line) to not put it out/up (or whatever directional word is appropriate, if even needed).

Here it is:
"IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! okayimnotgoingtotouchitorelseillmessitupagainlikeididwiththenqueenslike.an.idiot. BUT NOW IT WORKS. SO I HAVE REDEEMED MYSELF. I'll stop using caps now. I'm not an aggressive person ^.^ (or at least I don't think I am ^.^;), dear reader. Does anyone actually read the commits though? Well, enjoy yourselves if you are. And if you're not, well, it's not like you'll know what you're missing since you didn't read the commits annyway... That was long and [now] more than half has nothing to do with my file... Oh,well"

tl;dr It works, I didn't do stupid, Do people even read the commits?
